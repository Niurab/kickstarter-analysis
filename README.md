# Louise Fundraising Campaign

## Overview of the project
Helping an up and coming play-right, Louise start a fundraising campaign to help fund her play * *Fever. 

She is estimating a budget of over $10,000 and has turn to me to help her plan her fundraising campaign and set it up for success.

## Analysis and Challenges
The fundraising campaign was carried out using Microsoft Excel with the data provided. Pivot table, chart and line graph was used to give visualization to the project in other to help Louise better virtualize the analysis. Other functions used include filter function, conditional formatting, creating new sheets and renaming them and saving the charts as image. Sum and percentage functions were also used to add columns and rows.
The major challenge encountered was in using the * *COUNTIFS function. 

The challenge was thankfully solved using the tools provided in the model.

## Results
### Conclusions based on theatre outcomes by launch date
The first conclusion is having the fundraising campaign around **May and June.

These months tend to have higher success rates.

The second conclusion is that fundraising campaigns tend to be more successful than failed in all months of the year except in the month of **December. 

Therefore, the month of December is not a good month for fundraising campaign.

### Conclusion based on outcomes based on goals
The percentage successful goal outcomes was in the range 35,000 to 39,999 and 40,000 to 44,999 with 66.67 percent while the percentage failed goal outcomes was in the range 45,000 to 49,000. Going by the outcomes based on goals, Louise should be advised against setting a higher goal than 44,999.

### Limitations of the dataset
The data was from 2009 to 2017. Including some other years, countries and samples such as missing pledge amount would have helped the analysis. Another limitation of the dataset was the date the data was counted thereby necessitating date conversion.

### Other tables or graphs
Other tables or graphs we could have used include **box plot. 

Box plot or whisker plot or simply box is an effective way to show large amounts of information about a distribution in a small amount of space.
